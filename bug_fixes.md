## Bazingo Project Bug Fixes

    This document outlines the bug fixes implemented in the Bazingo project.

    ### Identified Bugs and Fixes

    1.  **Inconsistent Use of `IsDeleted` Flag:**

        *   **Problem:** The `IsDeleted` flag is not consistently used in all repository methods, potentially leading to incorrect data retrieval.
        *   **Fix:** Modify repository methods to always filter out entities where `IsDeleted` is true.

    2.  **Missing Exception Handling in Repositories:**

        *   **Problem:** Some repository methods lack proper exception handling, making it difficult to diagnose issues.
        *   **Fix:** Add try-catch blocks to repository methods to catch exceptions and log them appropriately.

    3.  **Potential Null Reference Exceptions:**

        *   **Problem:** Some code sections do not handle potential null reference exceptions, which can lead to application crashes.
        *   **Fix:** Add null checks to prevent null reference exceptions.

    4.  **Hardcoded Values:**

        *   **Problem:** Hardcoded values are used in several places, making the code less maintainable and configurable.
        *   **Fix:** Replace hardcoded values with constants or configuration settings.

    5.  **Missing Authorization Attributes:**

        *   **Problem:** Some controller actions lack proper authorization attributes, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
        *   **Fix:** Add appropriate `[Authorize]` attributes to controller actions.

    6.  **Potential Downgrade Issue:**

        *   **Problem:** The build log indicates a potential package downgrade issue with `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder`.
        *   **Fix:** Ensure consistent package versions across all projects.
